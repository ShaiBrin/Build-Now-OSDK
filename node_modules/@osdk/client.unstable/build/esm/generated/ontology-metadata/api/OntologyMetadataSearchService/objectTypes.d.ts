/**
 * This endpoint should only be used for batch processing workflows where all matches to a query need
 * to be retrieved with a consistent view of the search index across pages. For other workflows use the
 * `searchObjectTypes` endpoint.
 * Time between fetching consecutive pages must not be more than 1 minute. Clients should always
 * page until an empty page token is returned. Use the `searchObjectTypes` endpoint to avoid the timeout
 * between pages.
 *
 * The results in this endpoint are eventually consistent with the latest OntologyVersion and may lag slightly
 * behind the last Ontology modification.
