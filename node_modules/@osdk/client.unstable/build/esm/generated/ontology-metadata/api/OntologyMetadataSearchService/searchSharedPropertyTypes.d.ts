 * Endpoint to search SharedPropertyTypes based on various filters. Endpoint allows to return results based on
 * relevance of the match. There is no timeout between fetching consecutive pages and clients do not need to
 * page to the end. In some cases updates to the Ontology between fetching pages can cause the same result to
 * be returned more than once.
 *
 * The results in this endpoint are eventually consistent with the latest OntologyVersion and may lag slightly
 * behind the last Ontology modification.
