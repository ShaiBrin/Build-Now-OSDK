 * Endpoint to search ActionTypes based on various filters. Endpoint allows to return results based on relevance
 * of the match. There is no timeout between fetching consecutive pages and clients do not need to page to the end.
 * In some cases updates to the Ontology between fetching pages can cause the same result to be returned more than once.
 *
 * The results in this endpoint are eventually consistent with the latest OntologyVersion and may lag slightly
 * behind the last Ontology modification.
