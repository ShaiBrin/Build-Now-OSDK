 * Map integer to human-interpretable values. For example:
 * - 0 -> Not assigned
 * - 1 -> Assigned
 * - 2 -> Closed

 * Ontology design note: string enums are preferable. Like any formatter that changes the rendered values, this
 * can behave strangely for certain features (e.g. sorting won't be alphabetic, but on the underlying ordering).
