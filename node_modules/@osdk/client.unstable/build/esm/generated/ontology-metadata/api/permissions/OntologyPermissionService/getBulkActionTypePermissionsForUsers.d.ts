/**
 * Returns permissions that other users have on the ActionTypes provided. The result is scoped down to the
 * permissions that the calling authHeader has. If the provided authHeader does not have a certain permission,
 * the value returned in the response is not well defined, because we can't tell the provided authHeader whether
 * another user has a certain permission if they don't have it themselves. For example, if the provided authHeader
 * cannot edit an actiontype, then the returned boolean for whether another user has edit access to that action type
 * can be either true or false. In other words, this endpoint only provides accurate information about
 * permissions that the provided authHeader themselves have.
 *
 * Any action types that the provided auth header does not have view access to will not be returned in the
 * response. Limited to at most 50 entries per call.
