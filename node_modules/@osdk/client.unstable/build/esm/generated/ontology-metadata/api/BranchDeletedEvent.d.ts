/**
 * Event indicating that a branch was deleted. This event is only sent for deleted non-default branches and
 * can occur when an Ontology is hard-deleted or when a (closed/merged) branch is deleted because of retention.
 * If a default branch is deleted (because of an Ontology hard-deletion), OMS will instead send deletion events
 * for each individual entity in the Ontology.
 *
 * Any service consuming ontology events is expected to delete all data related to a non-default branch (i.e. all
 * specific ontology entities tracked for this brach) when a `BranchDeletedEvent` is received. OMS
 * will not send delete events for all entities on non-default branches during branch deletion.
