/**
 * Represents the status of a branch.
 * Inactive branches were branches that were open but were not modified for a specific timeout period (default
 * 14 days). Any indexed data on the branch is now deindexed. The branch can become open again via reactivating.
 * Open branches are the default state of a branch.
 * Merged branches are branches that had their modifications merged into the default branch of the ontology;
 * these branches cannot ever be modified or merged again.
 * Closed branches are branches that were manually closed. Closed branches are not reopenable and cannot
 * ever be modified or merged.
