/**
 * Note: This error does not block the branch from getting merged.
 *
 * Indicates that a datasource was deleted without the required schema migrations. Currently we only validate
 * for the most common schema migrations. Validation only looks at migrations with
 * `SourceSchemaVersion.latestVersion()`, other migrations will be ignored.
 * There may be some edge cases not covered by this validation.
 *
 * Schema Migrations that are validated for include:
 * - dropAllPatches
 * - dropDatasource, where the source datasource matches the deleted datasource
 * - renameDatasource, where the source matches the deleted datasource
 *
 * Edge cases include:
 * - dropDatasource does not check that the target datasource exists or is valid
