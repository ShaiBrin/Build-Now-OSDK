/**
 * Note: This error does not block the branch from getting merged.
 *
 * Indicates that a property type was deleted without the required schema migrations. Currently we only
 * validate for the most common schema migrations. Validation only looks at migrations with
 * `SourceSchemaVersion.latestVersion()`, other migrations will be ignored.
 * There may be some edge cases not covered by this validation.
 *
 * Schema Migrations that are validated for include:
 * - dropAllPatches
 * - dropProperty where the propertyTypeRid matches the deleted property
 * - renameProperty where the source matches the current propertyTypeRid and the target does not match the current propertyTypeId
