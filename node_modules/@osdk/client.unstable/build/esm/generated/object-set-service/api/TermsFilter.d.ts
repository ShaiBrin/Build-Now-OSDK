/**
 * This filter does not analyze the query string.
 *
 * An object matches a TermsFilter iff the tokens of the provided property match any of the provided terms.
 *
 * For example, a property with value "The Quick Brown Fox", using the default analyzer, would produce the tokens
 * ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"], and would therefore match a terms filter with "brown" as a term,
 * but not one with "Brown" or "Brown Fox" as a term.
 * It is recommended to use filter only against properties which support exact matches.
 *
 * If no property is provided, this filter will consider the tokens for all properties.
 * If no terms are provided, this filter will match all objects.
