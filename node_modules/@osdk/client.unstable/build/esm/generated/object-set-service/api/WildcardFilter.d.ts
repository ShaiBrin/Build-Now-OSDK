/**
 * This filter does not analyze the query string.
 *
 * An object matches a WildcardFilter iff the tokens of the provided property matches the term with a wildcard
 * suffix.
 *
 * For example, a query with value "The Quick Brown F" will search for tokens which match "The Quick Brown F*".
 * If searched on a property with the default analyzer with value "The Quick Brown Fox", it will not match
 * as the value tokens are ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox"].
 * It is recommended to use filter only against properties which support exact matches.
 *
 * If no property is provided, this filter will consider the tokens for all properties.
