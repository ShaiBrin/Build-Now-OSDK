 * Returns types of objects that can be present in the supplied object set based on its definition at the time

 * are that only the returned object types can be present in the supplied object set at the time of the request.
 * It is not however guaranteed that there in fact is at least one object of each returned object type - consider
 * using aggregations instead if false-positives are not desired.
 *
 * Note that object types belonging to an object set can change over time - this information should be treated as
 * dynamic and should not be persisted or treated as immutable.
