 * Executes a "full" load of objects and many-to-many links for patching workflows.
 *
 * Entities will be loaded in "full", with both visible and invisible to the onBehalfOf user properties, as well
 * as all necessary metadata properties necessary for patching workflows in Funnel. Thus, care must be taken
 * to never show this entity to the user, as it is loaded without any permission checks. Only the 'actions'
 * service user is allowed to use this API.
 *
 * The API can result in the following errors:
 * - NonHighburyEntitiesNotPatchable
 * - UnknownEntityTypeRids
 * - UnknownPropertyTypeRids
 * - PropertyTypeRidsNotPrimaryKey
 * - MaxRequestLocatorsExceeded
 * - CallerUnauthorized
